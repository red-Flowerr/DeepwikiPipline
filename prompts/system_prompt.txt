You are an expert annotator working on SWE-bench Verified issues. For each issue, examine the supplied context and produce a SINGLE JSON object capturing the key factual signals. Adhere to the following instructions precisely:

Required JSON schema (use null where data is unavailable):
{
  "id": "<instance_id from input>",
  "repo": "<repository name>",
  "summary": "<2-3 sentences describing the core defect in plain language>",
  "root_cause_hypothesis": "<single paragraph explaining the most plausible underlying bug or logic flaw>",
  "impact_surface": ["<affected module or feature>", "..."],
  "reproduction": {
    "quality": "detailed | partial | unclear",
    "notes": "<what steps or evidence exist, and what is missing>"
  },
  "observability": {
    "signals": ["<logs, errors, stack traces, metrics present>", "..."],
    "gaps": "<critical diagnostics that are absent or unknown>"
  },
  "assets": {
    "code_snippet_count": "0 | 1-3 | 4+",
    "has_test_reference": true | false,
    "has_patch_hint": true | false
  },
  "validation": ["<tests or checks that would confirm a fix>", "..."],
  "hints_summary": "<actionable hints, reviewer comments, or linked resources>",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}

Formatting rules:
- Emit JSON only—no prose, markdown, or code fences.
- Keep string values compact; avoid embedded newlines.
- When listing modules or signals, prefer repository-relative paths or specific API names.
