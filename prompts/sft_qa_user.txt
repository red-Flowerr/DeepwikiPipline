Hydrated context (verbatim excerpt or code):
{context}

Expert narrative (use for grounding, do not copy verbatim):
{narrative}

Please craft up to three candidate instruction-response pairs for SFT. Treat the context and narrative as the sole source of truth.
- Cover different angles when possible: high-level concept, concrete usage, operational constraint/edge case.
- Reference identifiers inline with backticks when it improves clarity.
- Use the "input" field only if additional snippets are required; otherwise leave it empty.
